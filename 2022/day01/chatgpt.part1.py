# Can you generate a python program that loads a specified as a command line argument -- the file is
# set of batches of of integers, separated by blank lines -- it finds the batch with largest sum?

# Yes, here is a python program that loads a file specified as a command line argument and finds the
# batch with the largest sum:

import sys

# Get the file name from the command line argument
file_name = sys.argv[1]

# Open the file
with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
  # Read the file line by line
  lines = f.readlines()

# Note from human: I had to rename this so it didn't replace the built-in sum function.
# Initialize the sum to 0
the_sum = 0

# Initialize the maximum sum to 0
max_batch_sum = 0

# Initialize the current batch
current_batch = []

# Iterate over the lines
for line in lines:
  # Check if the line is blank
  if line.strip() == '':
    # If the line is blank, check if the current batch's sum is larger than the maximum batch sum
    if sum(current_batch) > max_batch_sum:
      # If the current batch's sum is larger than the maximum batch sum, update the maximum batch sum and the sum
      max_batch_sum = sum(current_batch)
      the_sum = sum(current_batch)

    # Clear the current batch
    current_batch = []
  else:
    # If the line is not blank, convert the line to an integer and add it to the current batch
    current_batch.append(int(line))

# Print the sum
print(the_sum)


# This program reads the file name from the command line argument, and then reads the file line by
# line. It keeps track of the current batch of integers and its sum, and if it encounters a blank
# line, it checks if the current batch's sum is larger than the maximum batch sum. If it is, it
# updates the maximum batch sum and the sum. Finally, it prints the sum of the batch with the largest
# sum.

# Please note that this program assumes that the file contains only integers and blank lines. If the
# file contains any other data, the program will throw an error.

# I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
